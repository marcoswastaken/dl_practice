# Deep Learning Practice

This is a collection of some of the scripts and notebooks I've written while practicing with various deep learning tools and frameworks.

## Some books and courses 

A lot of the notebooks are inspired by examples and exercises from books I've read and courses I've followed, including:

 - [MIT Introduction to Deep Learning](https://github.com/aamini/introtodeeplearning)
 - [PyTorch - Applications of Deep Neural Networks](https://github.com/jeffheaton/app_deep_learning)
 - [The fastai book](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook)
